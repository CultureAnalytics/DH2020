# Network Studies of Culture

Following the 2019 workshop which focused on the use of time series as a way to understand and visualize humanities data, the 2020 workshop is dedicated to how network exploration and analysis can be similarly used to understand and visualize. The questions that focus the workshop are: How can network visualisations provide a distant viewing of data? What are the different steps to build a network? How to read it?

Similar to 2019, the workshop will begin with an introduction to culture analytics and network analysis offered as a framework for the rest of the workshop. Afterwards, there will be two brief presentations of research examples, one involving a small dataset and another one with big data. This will be followed by a hands-on tutorial with Gephi that will introduce participants to the basics of network exploration and analysis. Gephi is a popular network visualization and analysis tool. It helps scholars investigate empirical phenomena that can be seen as nodes and links, entities and relations. Drawing from graph theory and information design, it helps shifting the focus from the entities to their relations. It repurposes computational metrics to describe and characterize the topology of empirical networks.

## Audience

This half-day workshop offers an exploration of culture analytics and networks, aimed at an audience of students and scholars interested in understanding the intersection of analytics and the humanities. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops. The software required is Gephi or available online via GitHub (relevant links will be sent beforehand).

It repurposes computational metrics to describe and characterize the topology of empirical networks. In this tutorial you will learn the basics of Gephi, how to read its visualizations, which metrics to use in different situations, and how to organize an exploratory data analysis in a humanities setting.|

**John Laudun** is professor of English at the University of Louisiana (USA). His research focuses on folk narrative, both as a textual production in and of itself as well as a networked phenomenon. His published work includes a book-length study of embedded creativity and articles on folklore in both traditional and digital environments. In addition to scholarly journals and anthologies, his work is also featured in archives, CDs, films, and television series, and he has received funding from the NSF, NEH, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Jacob K. Javits program of the U.S. Department of Education. laudun@louisiana.edu. http://johnlaudun.net.


## About Culture Analytics

Culture Analytics is a collaborative, translational data science that explores culture and cultural interaction as a multi-scale / multi-resolution phenomenon. The macroscopic view, that allows a researcher to move from the microscale of close reading, up through the mesoscales, and on to the macroscale of distant reading, is a hallmark of the field. Culture analytics is focused on the productive intersection between humanities, mathematics, and data science.
