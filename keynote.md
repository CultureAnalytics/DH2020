## Conspiracy in the Time of Covid: A Computational Pipeline for the Discovery of Conspiracy Narrative Frameworks

### Tim Tangherlini 
#### University of California - Berkeley

This year's keynote is by one of the principal figures in culture analytics, Tim Tangherlini, who is now well into his second decade of research and collaborations focused on the ways that quantitative approaches and methods can be successfully not only brought into the humanities but how the adaptations required when doing so can be ported back into data, information, and computer sciences, making the latter not only better but also more humane in the process.
