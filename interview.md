# Interview with Tim Tangherlini

One of the things we strive to do as a working group is to remember the importance of people: we haven't done all this work to keep the ideas, theories, and methods presented in our workshops, papers, and publications to ourselves. (The last thing we want is to form a club.)

Our hope is to make all of these ideas, methods, theories, and approaches as accessible as possible, and we thought one way to do that, given that we are all in separate rooms and not in one room together, is to ask our interviewer to step off the figurative dias and sit down on the sofa next to us. Luckily for us, this year's keynoter was tickled by the idea and gladly set aside some time to ask him a host of questions. 

You can watch the interview before or after the keynote, though we think it makes a terrific introduction to the keynote, especially if your are still new to algortithmic approaches. In the interview, Tangherlini reveals his own approach is graced with a great deal of humor and willingness to make mistakes.
